Hello there! Are you looking for an open-source project related to basic web technologies? Here, I am developing a web app based on fundamental web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You are welcome to contribute your knowledge to this project.

## About the Project

I am working on a web app that generates multiple-choice question (MCQ) images and their options. These images can be integrated into videos for teaching purposes. You can visit the current version of the project at [https://jborgohain.github.io/freemcqgen/v2/](https://jborgohain.github.io/freemcqgen/v2/).

### What's Next (TODO)

1. **Portrait and Landscape Images**: We aim to generate portrait and landscape images in 720p or 1080p resolution that can be integrated into short videos. To achieve this, we plan to add radio options before the "Generate MCQ" button. Users can select either "Portrait" or "Landscape," and the image will be produced accordingly.

2. **Integrating Additional Diagrams**: We want to provide an optional upload picture input. Teachers can use this feature to upload diagrams or other relevant images that will be integrated into the generated MCQ images **bottom right corner**. There won't be a separate button for uploading; the "Generate MCQ" button will handle the integration of the picture or diagram into the final image.

3. **Image Naming**: We will make image naming **optional**. Users will have the choice to **rename** the generated image before its creation. They can simply provide the desired name before generating the image.

4. **Final Implementation**: Once the above features are implemented, we plan to create another web app where all the generated pictures can be uploaded. This app will then produce a video using these images. More thought and planning will be required for this stage.

Feel free to contribute to this project and help us improve it further!
